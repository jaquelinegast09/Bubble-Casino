BlackJack Game 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

* In this project we have created an iconic casino card game, BlackJack.
* In BlackJack, players try to acquire cards with a face value as close as possible to 21 without going over.
* The program also has a menu that gives you 5 options to choose from, which are: 1. special facts, 2. game rules, 3. a list of card face     values, 4. the blackjack game and 5. a quit option.

PROGRAM'S PURPOSE:

* The purpose of this program is to allow the player to play a game of BlackJack and to learn some information about the game, which is why   it includes the rules and card face values. If the player wants to they can even practice playing BlackJack on this program before a real   round of BlackJack at a casino.
